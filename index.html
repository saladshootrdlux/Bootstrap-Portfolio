      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="assets/images/case.JPG" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>My name is Case Griffiths. I am originally from La Jolla California which is a small surfing town North West
        of San Diego. I moved to Berkeley on Scholarship to the University of California where I received my Bachelors
        in Digital Media, after which I moved to Portland, Oregon where I live now with my girlfriend Jeanelle and our
        beagle puppy Harley.</p>

      <p>I have been working in technology for my entire life. I started by building my first computer at age 9. It was
        a broken Windows PC that my mom said I could have if I could fix it. I tinkered with it for days and eventually
        surmised that it was the video card that was broken. I asked my mom for a new video card and it was my only
        Christmas present in 1996. It worked. That moment would mark the beginning of a life long passion for tech.</p>

      <p>Today, I have worked for some of the world's premier technology companies, such as Sony, Qualcomm, Apple, and
        Salesforce. I work on PCs, Macs, and Linux. I am a certified Apple repair tech, and now I work at marketing
        technology start ups in Downtown Portland, the most recent being my current employer, Opal Labs.</p>

      <p>In my free time I like to tinker with technology, fly drones, go camping, play music, and see shows. I have
        recently gotten into rock climbing, and now I am training to become a web developer. My girlfriend (the one in
        the picture) hates potatoes.</p>
