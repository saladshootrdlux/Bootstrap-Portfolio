                    <p style="text-indent: 30px;">My name is Case Griffiths. I am originally from La Jolla California which is a small surfing
                        town North West of San Diego. I moved to Berkeley on Scholarship to the University of
                        California where I received my Bachelors in Digital Media, after which I moved to Portland,
                        Oregon where I live now with my girlfriend Jeanelle and our beagle puppy Harley.</p>
                    <p style="text-indent: 30px;">I have been working in technology for my entire life. I started by building my first computer at
                        age 9. It was a broken Windows PC that my mom said I could have if I could fix it. I tinkered
                        with it for days and eventually surmised that it was the video card that was broken. I asked my
                        mom for a new video card and it was my only Christmas present in 1996. It worked. That moment
                        would mark the beginning of a life long passion for tech.</p>
                    <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Today, I have worked for some of the world's premier technology companies, such as Sony,
                        Qualcomm, Apple, and Salesforce. I work on PCs, Macs, and Linux. I am a certified Apple repair
                        tech, and now I work at marketing technology start ups in Downtown Portland, the most recent
                        being my current employer, Opal Labs.</p>
